However, please note that these are not specific to the patient's individual needs and should be tailored accordingly.\n\nTypically, for patients with Type 2 diabetes, regular follow-ups with their healthcare provider are crucial to monitor blood sugar control, adjust treatment plans as needed, and prevent potential complications. Some recommended follow-up care steps may include:\n\n* Regular monitoring of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels to assess blood sugar control\n* Adjusting medication regimens or adding new medications as necessary\n* Encouraging lifestyle modifications such as a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and stress management\n* Monitoring for potential complications like kidney disease, nerve damage, or vision problems\n\nTo provide more personalized recommendations, I would need access to the patient's current treatment plan, laboratory results, and any other relevant clinical data. Would you like me to review their specific information and generate a more tailored list of follow-up care suggestions?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | This patient has complex chronic conditions including Diabetes with multiple complications (neuropathy, retinopathy, renal disease), a recent hip fracture (December 2015), and chronic sinusitis.
